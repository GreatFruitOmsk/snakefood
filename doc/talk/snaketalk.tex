=============

- Prepare submission and slides for PyCon presentation

  Talk outline:

  - intro/motivation: the use of dependencies
  - implementation details
    * zero config
    * does not run code
  - makefile + dataflow chart for deps/clusters/dot, etc.
  - examples
  - enforcing specific dependencies in a subversion hook

``This is all theoretically cool, but in practice, you're trying to
  answer a question.  For example, you're trying to answer the
  question like Why does this module depend on this other one? or Why
  is there a circular dependency here, and how can I remove it?''


- checker + integration with sfood-gendeps



motivation:

- init-time code is bad, you need to know your dependencies
- tools like Eclipse offer a bad cognitive model
