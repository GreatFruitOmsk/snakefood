=============

- Prepare submission and slides for PyCon presentation

  Talk outline:

  - intro/motivation: the use of dependencies
  - implementation details
    * zero config
    * does not run code
  - makefile + dataflow chart for deps/clusters/dot, etc.
  - examples
  - enforcing specific dependencies in a subversion hook





motivation:

- init-time code is bad, you need to know your dependencies
- tools like Eclipse offer a bad cognitive model
