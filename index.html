<h1 class="title">snakefood: Python Dependency Graphs</h1>

<div class="section" id="description">
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Generate dependency graphs from Python code.  This dependency tracker
package has a few distinguishing characteristics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It uses the AST to parse the Python files.  This is pretty reliable.</li>
<li>No module is loaded.  Loading modules to figure out dependencies is
almost always problem, because a lot of codebases run initialization
code in the global namespace, which often requires additional setup.
Snakefood is guaranteed not to have this problem (it just runs, no
matter what).</li>
<li>It works on a set of files, i.e. you do not have to specify a single
script, you can select a directory (package or else) or a set of
files.  It finds all the Python files recursively automatically.</li>
<li>Your PYTHONPATH is automatically adjusted to include the required
package roots.  It figures out the paths that are required from the
files/directories given as input.  You should not have to setup
ANYTHING.</li>
<li>It does not have to automatically 'follow' dependencies between
modules, i.e. by default it only considers the files and directories
you specify on the command-line and their immediate dependencies.
It also has an option to automatically include only the dependencies
within the packages of the files you specify.</li>
<li>It follows the UNIX philosophy of small programs that do one thing
well: it consists of a few simple programs whose outputs you combine
via pipes.  Graphing dependencies always requires the user to filter
and cluster the filenames, so this is appropriate.  You can combine
it with your favourite tools, grep, sed, etc.</li>
<li>The code is darn simple and there very little of it.  We have run it
on a variety of popular Python packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>A problem with dependency trackers that run code is that they are
unreliable, due to the dynamic nature of Python (the presence of
imports within function calls and __import__ hooks makes it almost
impossible to always do the right thing).  This script aims at being
right 99% of the time, and we think that given the trade-offs, 99% is
good enough for 99% of the uses.</p>
<p>I fully intend that this program work on all codebases.  It has been
tested on a number of popular open source codes (see the test
directory).</p>
