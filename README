   snakefood: Python Dependency Graphs
=========================================


Description
===========

Generate dependency graphs from Python code.  This dependency tracker
package has a few distinguishing characteristics:

- It uses the AST to parse the Python files

- No module is loaded.  There is often code in the global namespace
  that gets run when you import a module.

- It works on a set of files, i.e. you do not have to specify a single script,
  you can select a package or a set of files.

- It does not automatically 'follow' dependencies between modules,
  i.e. it only considers the files and directories you specify on the
  command-line and their immediate dependencies.

- It follows the UNIX philosophy of small programs that do one thing
  well, so you can combine it with your favourite tools, grep, sed,
  etc.

- The code is damn simple and there very little of it.

A problem with dependency trackers that run code is that they are
unreliable anyway, due to the dynamic nature of Python (the presence
of imports within function calls and __import__ hooks makes it almost
impossible to always do the right thing ).  This script aims at being
right 99% of the time, and we think that this is good enough for 99%
of the uses.
