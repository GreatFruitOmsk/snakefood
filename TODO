snakefood
=========

- When recursing through files, check for non .py files that may be Python code
  too and include them.


snakefood-graph
===============

- Support dot subgraphs somehow.  This program should be able to take
  some prefixes on the command-line and group the nodes together
  somehow.

- Support coloring: the program should take some prefixes on the
  command-line and colour the related nodes together.
