snakefood
=========

- Add an option to only report dependencies inside of roots of the
  files and directories that were specified on the command-line.  This
  would be a very useful option! TODO:

  - For each of the files specified as arguments, get the package root
  - Before doing the final output, filter out entries whose from_root
    or to_root are not in this set.

- When recursing through files, check for non .py files that may be Python code
  too and include them.



snakefood-graph
===============

- Support dot subgraphs somehow.
