snakefood
=========

- Finish complete test suite.

- Feature: When recursing through files, check for non .py files that
  may be Python code too and include them.


snakefood-clusters
==================

- Support non-prefix clusters: We could try clustering a variety of
  modules by hand, according to the documentation groupings, but that
  would require supporting cluster groups that do not depend on a
  filename prefix.  Do that for stdlib analysis.


snakefood-graph
===============

- Support dot subgraphs somehow.  This program should be able to take
  some prefixes on the command-line and group the nodes together
  somehow.

- Support coloring: the program should take some prefixes on the
  command-line and colour the related nodes together.
