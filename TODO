   TODO: snakefood
=====================

snakefood
=========

- Add new popular codebases to tests.


snakefood-cluster
=================

- Support non-prefix clusters: We could try clustering a variety of
  modules that do not share a common filename prefix.  Each of these
  clusters should be called "cluster groups".  Maybe we could extend
  the cluster file format slightly to support that instead of forcing
  it to be multiple files.

- Add an option to filter out/ignore all the files that are not in the
  declared clusters.


snakefood-graph
===============

- Make the graphs a lot prettier.  I'm not a Graphviz expert by any
  measure and I generally don't care much about pretty, so if someone
  wants to contribute that could be a good area.

  - Support dot subgraphs somehow.  snakefood-graph should be able to
    take some prefixes on the command-line and group the nodes
    together somehow.

  - Support coloring: the program should take some prefixes on the
    command-line and colour the related nodes together.


Other
=====

- Create a new snakefood-filter script that does the same as
  --internal (use the set of roots from the dependency sources).



Documentation
=============

- Prepare submission and slides for PyCon presentation

  Talk outline:

  - intro/motivation: the use of dependencies
  - implementation details
    * zero config
    * does not run code
  - makefile + dataflow chart for deps/clusters/dot, etc.
  - examples
  - enforcing specific dependencies in a subversion hook
