snakefood
=========

- BUG: If a file does not import anything, it should still appear.

- When recursing through files, check for non .py files that may be Python code
  too and include them.



snakefood-graph
===============

- Support dot subgraphs.


snakefood-cluster
=================

- Automatically remove dependencies on one-self, they create unnecessary arrows.
